Welcome to this repository that aims to analyse the data from the APS experiment performed at LaPsyDÃ‰. In summary, APS (Auditory Perception Simulation) is a reading strategy in which readers imagine an external
narrator's voice (hence *simulating* it) while performing a silent reading task (reading in their heads). In Zhou and Christianson's 2016 eyetracking study**, APS was found to help readers achieve a higher understanding
of complex sentences. Our experiment aimed to reproduce theirs on a population of French speaking adults. We ended up doing the experiment in three different formats:

  1. In-lab, on a population of native french speakers. We also recorded eye-tracking data for this one.
  2. Online, on a population of native french speakers.
  3. Online, on a population of native english speakers.

You will therefore find here all the files needed to:
  1. Transform the raw data into exploitable data:
     In *Data/ParticipantLogCreation_online* for the online experiments
